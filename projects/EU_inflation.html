<h3>1. Understanding inflation and recent trends</h3>
<p align="justify">Inflation is the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in purchasing power. Some economists argue that moderate, steadily increasing inflation is healthy for the economy. However, high and volatile inflation dampens economic growth, erodes savings, and has a regressive effect on lower-income families and older people in society.
<br> <br>
Recently, there has been a surge in inflation globally. While it is extremely complex to diagnose the cause of this phenomenon, the International Monetary Fund (Agarwal, R. & Kimball M., 2022) and other organizations have identified five key drivers:
<ul>
<li><b>Supply chain bottlenecks</b>: Several supply chain bottlenecks have emerged in the later stage of the pandemic, affecting particularly raw materials, intermediate manufactured goods, and freight transport.</li>
<li><b>Increase of demands of goods</b>: Evidence suggests that, during the pandemic, there was a substantial shift in demands toward goods and away from services, most of which were inaccessible during lockdowns. </li>
<li><b>Post-pandemic recovery</b>: Households depleted the savings that they had accumulated due to the large fiscal stimuli and transfers provided by the government, leading to an increase in overall demand and a stronger economic recovery than anticipated.</li>
<li><b>Shocks to labor supply</b>: Labor market disruptions caused by the pandemic seem to be persistent, as labor supply participation remains below pre-pandemic levels in several countries.</li>
<li><b>The Russian invasion of Ukraine</b>: The invasion as further exacerbated pre-existing inflationary trends. Both Russia and Ukraine are significant exporters of key commodities, and the disruptions caused by the war and sanctions have led to a rise in global prices, particularly for oil, natural gas, and food items.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Visualizing inflation in the European Union</h3>
<p align="justify">Inflation is typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. To measure the aggregate inflation of the European Union, however, it is necessary to use the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP has been devised by Eurostat and relies on a harmonised methodology for compiling consumer price indices in the Member States and the European Economic Area. More information can be found <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=HICP_methodology#A_harmonised_methodology_for_the_HICP>here</a>.<br> <br>
Let’s see first how the HICP changed over time.
    <br>
</p>

<br>    
<p align="justify">The graph shows that, on average, HICP in the EU-27 has been rising steadily from 2006 to 2020. However, from 2021 onwards, prices have surged dramatically. Let’s now look at how HICP changed for an important basket of goods and services through an animation made in R.

<br>
    <p align="justify"> In the period considered, all selected items have risen in price. The increase in foods and drinks progressed steadily and slowly until February 2022, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started. From then onwards, the price of all food and drinks considered started increasing at a faster rate. For example, the average monthly rate of increase in the price of bread in the first 12 months (i.e., from January 2021 to January 2022) was 0.61%. Conversely, from February 2022 to November 2022, the price of bread increased at an average rate of 1.85% monthly. This is unsurprising, given that Ukraine and Russia account for 30 percent of global wheat exports (IMF, 2022). It is important to remember that, particularly for the other items in this category, inflation is also driven by a mix of production bottlenecks, higher energy prices, and higher freight costs. The price of petrol increased sharply in the first 12 months, peaked at 51.5% in June 2022, and finally plateaued at ~33% in August 2022. Clothing, instead, fluctuates throughout the entire period. Finally, from March 2021, both electricity and gas surged sharply. The average monthly rate of increase in gas prices is the highest from February 2022 onwards. In November 2022, gas cost 102% more than in January 2021, whereas electricity prices increased by 50%.
